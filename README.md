### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<a class="button" href="#">GitHub</a>
```

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .button {
    @apply bg-main-grey font-bold p-3 rounded-lg transition ease-in-out duration-1000 hover:bg-main-green hover:shadow-md hover:shadow-main-green hover:text-black;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I Still Didn't Completely Understand How To Make My Animation in the Tailwind CSS Framework So I've a lot to Learn in The Current Technologies I'm Using Right Now Or The Other Technologies I Want To Learn The in Future.
